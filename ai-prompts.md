## üìú AI Prompts Used

### Frontend task


- Create a node project that wraps this Vue script. Use Vite as the build tool. The index page for the project must include the drag-drop component.
- I want to change how the elements of items are displayed in the preview div. The value of each element in items can be the string  "Text" or "Button". If the value of an element is "Text" I want an input tag of type text added to the preview div. If the value of an element is "Button" I want a Button tag added to the preview div. Assume that other string values may be added to the items array in the future so the solutino should be easy to extend to cover further types of element in the future. 
- I need to update the button component to set the child of the button tag to be teh default text of "Click Me". The current approach of just setting props on the component tag does not allow for this.
